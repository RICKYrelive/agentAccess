# Change: Document UI Interaction Diagrams Analysis

## Why
The Agent Access project has three UI interaction diagrams in the draft folder that provide critical insights into the system's user interface design, functionality, and workflow. These diagrams need to be formally documented to preserve the analysis and serve as reference for future development work.

## What Changes
- Document comprehensive analysis of the three UI interaction diagrams from `/draft/` folder
- Create specifications for the main interface, knowledge base interaction, and workflow configuration
- Preserve the architectural insights gained from zai MCP analysis
- Store analysis results in OpenSpec format for future reference

## Impact
- Affected specs: `ui-interface` (new capability)
- Provides foundational documentation for UI/UX design decisions
- Serves as reference for implementing the Agent Access interface
- Documents current understanding of the system architecture and user flows
