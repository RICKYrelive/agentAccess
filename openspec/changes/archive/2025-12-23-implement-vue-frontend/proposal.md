# Change: Implement Vue.js Frontend for Agent Access

## Why
Based on the UI interaction diagrams analysis documented in `document-ui-interaction-diagrams`, the Agent Access project needs a complete web application implementation to bring the interface specifications to life. Currently, the project only contains documentation and specifications with no actual implementation.

## What Changes
- Implement a complete Vue.js + TypeScript web application
- Create three-column layout as specified in UI diagrams
- Implement knowledge base integration functionality
- Build visual workflow editor with drag-and-drop capabilities
- Add MCP service configuration interface
- Create multi-agent support system
- Implement real-time preview and testing capabilities

## Impact
- Affected specs: `frontend` (new capability)
- Adds complete web frontend to existing Python backend structure
- Provides user interface for all documented UI specifications
- Enables actual user interaction with Agent Access system
- Files to be created: Complete Vue.js project structure under `agentaccess-frontend/`
